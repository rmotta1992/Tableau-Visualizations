## Scope
This project uses Tableau to visualize NYC's CitiBike program. The data available on the bikeshare program was quite large so some cleaning was needed before it could be utilized. Using Tableau amazing vizualtions can be created to show data. The program's vizuals are both useful and appealing to the eye so it makes it nicer for end users to views. Tableau also allows you to embed your visualizations into HTML so you can publish it to website for more convenient viewing and greater user access. 

## Technologies Used
Jupyter Notebook - used for loading and cleaning the big data associated with this project

[Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/robert.motta#!/vizhome/tableau-challenge_16105739802760/Story1) - used to visuaize the data in a appealing and easy to understand graphs

HTML - used to design a site to embed the visualizes 

## Findings

1.	Many stations appear to be popular for both original rental and return of bikes.
2.	The star of the coivd-19 pandemic drastically reduced the number of CitiBike rentals.
3.	It appears that the further a station is from mid or downtown Manhattan the longer average trip is. This could mean that people are often using the bikes to commute to work in Manhattan.
4.	Stations appears to be located in onlt the more affluent neighborhoods of NYC. Next round of addition of stations adding more to less affluent areas should be considered.
